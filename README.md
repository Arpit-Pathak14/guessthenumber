# guessthenumber
In this program, I have created a loop 
in wich the user has to guess a number 
between 1 and 10 (I have choosen it, you
can choose as per as your wish)
If the user guessed it right 
he will be out of the loop and 
if he doesn't , then the loop will continue

I have also created a app interface using flask 
You can take the template from index.html and css 
style from style.css files
